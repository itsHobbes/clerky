# clerky

- [Add me to your server!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=821516748800917534&permissions=76816&scope=bot)

Once added, you only need to run the setup command once.

`clerky!setup -c "Your Category" -n 5 -u 3 --channel "Your Channel Name"`

Note: When clerky creates a voice channel, it will attempt to sync the voice channel permissions with the category permissions. If clerky does not have a specific permission (e.g video), it will not be able to sync that permission.
